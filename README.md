# Classification-Regression
**Skills used:** Python, pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, sklearn, SMOTE

**Project Objective:** Using a vast data/features of bank customers, create a model that would determine which customers are likely to subscribe to a term deposit.

**Quantifiable result:** I was able to get a accuracy score of 90%

- Logistic regression came out to be a very effective model.
- I used a 0.30 test size and it gave me the best results.
- I used a dummies to encode the categoriclas.
- I used SMOTE because the two classes were highly imbalanced.
